The main objectives of the system are:
- **User Authentication**: To verify the authenticity of voters and protect against unauthorized access.
- **Candidate Registration**: To allow candidates to register and ensure the creation of a comprehensive and accurate list for voters.
- **Voting Mechanism**: To design a user-friendly interface for voters to cast their ballots electronically.
- **Result Viewing**: To implement a transparent and easily accessible result display for voters.

### Scope of Project
The scope of the project includes:
- **User Accessibility**: Ensuring the system is simple and accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.
- **Scalability**: The system is scalable to accommodate various numbers of voters and candidates in different elections.
- **Security**: Robust security measures to safeguard the voting process.
- **Result Transparency**: Ensuring that election results are displayed in a tamper-proof manner.

## Methodology

### Tools and Technologies
The system utilizes the following tools:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MS Access
- **GUI**: JFrame (Java Swing)

### Concepts Used in the Project
- **Classes & Objects**: The system is built using several classes, such as `Registration`, `Leader`, `Chairman`, `Project`, `Result`.
- **Polymorphism & Abstraction**: These concepts are applied to simplify complex tasks, using object-oriented design principles.
- **Exception Handling**: The code includes mechanisms for handling runtime errors and providing user-friendly feedback.

## Implementation

### Software Requirements
The system requires the following:
- **NetBeans IDE**
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**
- **MS Access** for database management

### Key Functionalities
- **Voting**: Users can select candidates from a combo box and vote electronically.
- **Database Integration**: The system connects to MS Access using JDBC for storing and retrieving data.
- **Result Display**: The system transparently displays results, including party-wise and leader-wise votes.
- **Login & Registration**: Voters can log in or register to ensure secure access to the voting platform.

#### Code Example for Database Operations:
```java
// Example of connecting to MS Access Database
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:ucanaccess://path_to_database");

// Query to insert user vote
String insertQuery = "INSERT INTO user_votes (candidate) VALUES (?)";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(insertQuery);
pstmt.setString(1, selectedCandidate);
pstmt.executeUpdate();
